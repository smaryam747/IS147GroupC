Project Description: 
Our web based project will solve the common problem of interaction fatigue, decision-making stalls during casual games like Truth or Dare, Would You Rather, Trivia, and similar party or conversation-style games, and just straight up boredom. People often run out of creative ideas, struggle to keep the game flowing, or simply lack someone to play with. Our bot addresses these issues by not only acting as a game host that provides prompts and questions, but also can be an active participant that plays alongside users or suggests interesting moves and ideas. This helps maintain engagement, reduce awkwardness, and ensure that anyone can have a good gaming experience.
